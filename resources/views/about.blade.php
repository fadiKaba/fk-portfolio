                <h5>Daily allowances of fruit and vegetables</h5>
                <p>Different fruits and vegetables contain different nutrients. The Australian dietary
                    guidelines recommend that adults eat at least five kinds of vegetable and two kinds of 
                    fruit every day. A national nutrition survey conducted by the Australian Government showed 
                    Australians of all ages do not eat enough vegetables and fruit.

                <p>Children have a smaller stomach capacity and higher energy needs than adults. They cannot
                    eat the same serving sizes as adults. However, you should encourage your children to eat
                    a variety of fruits and vegetables. By eating well, your children will have the energy 
                    they need to play, concentrate better, learn, sleep better and build stronger teeth and
                    bones. Building good habits in their early years can also provide the protection of a 
                    healthy diet throughout their lives.
